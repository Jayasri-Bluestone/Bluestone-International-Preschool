      <p>Sensory play includes any activity that stimulates a young child's senses: touch, smell, taste, movement, balance, sight and hearing.</p>
      <h3>The Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brain Development:</strong> Sensory play strengthens neural pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine Motor Skills:</strong> Activities like pouring, pinching, and sorting build hand strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Language:</strong> Children learn descriptive words like 'sticky', 'slimy', or 'vibrant'.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At Bluestone, we believe that children learn best when they can investigate the world with their own hands.</p>

      <p>EQ is often more important than IQ for long-term success. But how do we teach it to a 3-year-old?</p>
      <h3>Key Strategies:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Label the Feeling:</strong> "I see you are feeling frustrated because the block fell."</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy Building:</strong> Reading stories and asking, "How do you think the character feels?"</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Spaces:</strong> Creating a 'calm-down corner' instead of a time-out chair.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Teaching empathy today creates a kinder world tomorrow.</p>
